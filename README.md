# citation_graph
Learn Javascript + make citation graph + use ResearchGate API or any other API



## Functionality 

* It will be interactive with a panning window that will automatically adjust to the current citation of interest. 

* Since, a citation graph will be very messy with multiple lines going from one place to another, the most relevant papers (1 edge apart) will be the most dark and the more the irrelevance, the lighter in color would be the edges.

* This is a hypothesis: Papers with more citations are of interest to you, if and only if you are surveying that field or paper for the first time. So for those cases, we could have papers with more citations a larger font. This option should be toggle-able. 

* ResearchGate offers highlights of who said what about the current paper of interest. Those highlights should also be visible when the cursor is at the edge and you press a certain key, say *shift* or *ctrl*.

* It would be also awesome if you could swipe through those highlights with the mouse scroll when the key (*shift* or *ctrl*) is pressed down. It would look like your spinning a shuttlecock (from badminton) by its cork fixed in position, examining each feather one by one as each gets close to you. Naturally, the closest ones will look larger and so should the highlights be. 

* Exporting capability: this graph should be exportable to a table if possible
